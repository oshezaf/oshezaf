My name is Ofer Shezaf, and I have been an InfoSec professional for more than I care to remember. Well, when it was still called InfoSec and not Cyber.

Information security products are different than any other software product. Creating software products requires matching technology to customer requirements. As a risk mitigation methodology, security solutions require adding security expertise and the customer perception of risk to the product recipe.

I have spent my career at the junction of these three disciplines: combining a background in security research, product definition, and extensive customer-facing activity, enabling me to create security products that best reduce the real and perceived cyber risk.

I am currently a principal product manager working on Azure Sentinel at Microsoft.
